# INSIGHTS

* **Huge Funnel drop-off**: There is a largest funnel drop-off at Clicks to Purchase step (Mobile: 65% and Desktop: 62.5%) suggesting payment failures, limited options etc. This can be optimized by adding different payment options (COD), or guest checkout etc.
* **Mobile outperforms desktop**: People are more engaged on Mobile compared to desktop and also have higher final conversion rate (Mobile:16.98% v/s Desktop:12.24%) but the checkout is still a barrier. So, simplifying the mobile checkout results in better yield.
* **Users actively evaluating products**: Intents are dominated by Product search and Product comparison. This suggests users are evaluating the available options actively and the merchants could also add detailed product pages, reviews, comparison tools, clear delivery dates can improve the decision-making.
* **Strengthen Post-purchase Intent**: Track Order and FAQ shows users still have doubts like " Where is the order?", "How to return the order?" etc. So, merchants should proactively send the order updates and make the FAQs visible beforehand. This strengthens the communication after purchase.
* **SLA Performance**: The overall cancellations are low but there is one violation in the cancelled orders. So, the cancellation policy must be tightened so that there is no waste of time and the violations can be monitored closely.

# EXPERIMENT:

### Simplifying Mobile checkout Test: 
* This can be done by making changes like, reducing the number of fields, including auto-fill address, various payment options (UPI/Google Pay etc.), decreasing loading time of the check-out page, ensuring secure payments.
* **Testing**: It can be checked by comparing the current available model with the model created after enhancing the checkout page.
* **Success Metric**: Increase in the Clicks to Purchase conversion rate on mobile. If there is a significant increase from the current 37.5%, it means the experiment worked. Other metrics could be checkout completion time etc.
